Each Node can have two immediate children nodes
There is a root node 
The nodes at the end are called as leaf nodes.

## Types of Binary Tree

### Full Binary Tree

Each Node has either 2 or zero immediate children.

## Complete Binary Tree

All levels are completely filled except last level.
All nodes in last level are on the left side.

### Degenerate Tree


A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list. A degenerate or pathological tree is a tree having a single child either left or right.
